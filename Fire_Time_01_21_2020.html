									<h1>Fire Time, <br />
                                        Fire Eyes.</h1>
									<p>Can't help but rhyme.<br> I have a lot on my mind<br />
                                        and not enough time<br>
                            
                                    </p>

                                <p>I know I have a lot to do --<br>
And that always seems to be the case. </p>

As I sit beside this fireplace,<br>
I get a taste. . . WAIT<br>
Known.best, I have to CHASE<br>
My dreams and aspirations before they Fade. <br>
Away, vibrant colors don't turn to gray, <br>
They fade and fade until the next phase.<br>
Phase One, Phase Two, Phase 3, -No more<br>
When the tasks are all finished, <br>
Then I can walk through that Door.<br>
But WAIT, where will I find the time to meditate?<br>
I said WAIT â€¦.  I can't catch up & that always seems to be the case. <br>
Curiosity leads me to a different place, <br>
Because the zoning of my tasks feels so far away.<br>
All I wish is some ease to concentrate. <br>
All I need is a plan with one goal each day.<br>
Far beyond what takes hold, is a better way, <br>
Far along, growing strong is a brighter flame. <br>
Nonetheless time says yes and cannot delay,<br>
Better yet, now I met my deadline for grace<br>
Never planned, just cold hands by the fireplace<br>
As the sun, fades away to a darker place<br>
But the fire remains, and the passion is the same,<br>
Though the do's still await, I say WAIT . . .<br>
Take a moment to enjoy your maze. <br>
You'll find your way, if not today, each turn to lead is never the same. <br>
The maze is great, the way is late, the time is gone, to fade away.<br>
At least your fire burns and blaze,<br>
Don't let that fade too, because ashes are gray. <br>
Make time to know yourself and grow.<br>
Build up your confidence and never let love go.<br>
Each step, each tasks, has trouble of its own,<br>
But if you remember the fire that says you'll never be alone.<br>
So take time to own, what you truly hold<br>
Inside of your heart are treasures unknown,<br>
Where tasks cannot go, and time cannot throw<br>
A curveball to your MODE, all things must flow.<br>
For Destiny knows, and waits and waits for you.<br>
For Destiny shows you dreams and visions can come true. <br>
Deep down inside the brightest fire<br>
 is a log that burns slow,<br>
Deep down is your desires,<br>
That are still unknown.<br>
Self-discovery is a journey, a maze where we glow<br>
Into the brightest vibrancy radiantly low. <br>
Slow, and low, is where you should go<br>
To know, behold, the stories untold. <br>
The maze is your heart, a map to your confusion<br>
The tasks and the time are just mere illusions.<br>
The walls to break down, the new ways you found<br>
To lead you along where your joy abounds.<br>
Don't ever burn out. <br>
Don't ever burn down.<br>
Keep that fire blazing because you are amazing.<br>
Known. <br>
